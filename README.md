# Online-Sensor-Drift-Compensation-Matlab-Code
Source codes for "Online Sensor Drift Compensation for E-Nose Systems Using Domain Adaptation and Extreme Learning Machine".

# Description: 

The source codes I just uploaded are for experimental purpose. Therefore, there is no demo script. For better understanding, each script contains a functionality description. So there should be no problem in using these files. Another thing is that I do write several experimental files, such as 'MainFrame_ODAELMS'. You can easily find them by just looking at their names.
